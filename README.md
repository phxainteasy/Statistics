# Statistics & A/B Testing Notebook

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** I created to explore **A/B testing** and core **statistical concepts**.  
It’s designed for **data analysts, data scientists, and learners** who want to see how different values affect statistical measures and experiment outcomes in a hands-on way.

## What’s Inside

The notebook covers:

- **Distribution types**: Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, and how they relate to real-world experiments  
- **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** and its implications for sampling  
- **Critical values, Type I & II errors**, and statistical power  
- **A/B testing workflow**: from hypothesis to interpreting p-values  
- Interactive examples: you can change parameters and **see how graphs and metrics update**

## How to Use

1. Open the notebook in **JupyterLab** or **Google Colab**.  
2. Follow the explanations and formulas in the Markdown cells.  
3. Change input parameters (like sample size, conversion rates, significance level) to explore how they affect results.  
4. Optional: Run the included code snippets to generate plots and calculate metrics.

## Why This Notebook

This project can help you **solidify your understanding of statistics and A/B testing** while preparing for interviews.  
It’s also a playful way to explore **how statistical values interact in experiments** — and maybe spark interest in deeper discussions about data science data analytics concepts.
